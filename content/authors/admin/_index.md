I'm a graduate student in city planning at UNC-Chapel Hill, where I focus on affordable housing, housing finance, and disaster recovery. 

I am also a fellow at UNC School of Government's Development Finance Initiative (DFI) where I focus on affordable housing development in disaster-prone communities.
